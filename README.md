## Multi-Token Payment System

This branch introduces a comprehensive multi-token payment system that allows:

1. Merchants to price products in different tokens (SOL or USDC)
2. Customers to pay with any supported token
3. On-chain price discovery via Jupiter API
4. Accurate price conversions based on real-time liquidity

### Key Features:
- Token pricing selection in product creation/edit
- Real-time token price conversion
- Multiple payment options in checkout
- Consistent pricing across payment methods

The system uses on-chain price discovery to ensure the most accurate rates for token conversions.
