# Wallet Authentication Security Fix

## Issue Description

A critical security vulnerability was identified in the wallet authentication system where users could access order data without providing a valid authentication token. This was detected in the security panel showing "Access without auth token: Success with data (SECURITY ISSUE)".

The issue was in the RLS (Row Level Security) policy that allows access to the orders table. The existing validation function `auth.validate_wallet_headers()` didn't properly enforce the requirement for a valid authentication token.

## Fix Details

The fix consists of the following changes:

1. **Enhanced Token Validation**: Updated the `auth.validate_wallet_headers()` function to strictly enforce token presence and validation
2. **Improved RLS Policy**: Updated the "secure_wallet_orders_policy" to prevent access without proper token authentication
3. **Secured View**: Modified the `user_orders` view to properly enforce wallet token authentication
4. **Security Auditing**: Added logging of the security fix to help track security improvements over time

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Apply the migration by running:

```bash
supabase db push supabase/migrations/20250631000000_fix_wallet_auth_security.sql
```

2. Test the security fix using the updated security test utility:

```bash
npm run test:security
```

3. Verify in the Wallet Authentication Debug panel that the "Access without auth token" test now correctly fails

## Technical Details

The primary issue was in how the token validation was implemented. The previous version didn't explicitly reject requests without an auth token and had issues with token format validation.

The updated validation function now:

1. Strictly checks that both wallet address and auth token headers exist and aren't empty
2. Properly validates that the wallet address matches the target wallet
3. Verifies the token format conforms to one of our accepted formats
4. Defaults to secure denial behavior (fail-safe approach)

## Impact

This fix prevents unauthorized access to user wallet data, resolving a significant data privacy concern. All requests to wallet-specific data now require properly authenticated tokens, ensuring only verified wallet owners can access their data.

## Verification

After applying the fix, you can verify it's working by:

1. Opening the debug panel in the app
2. Running the security tests
3. Confirming "Access without auth token" test now shows "Failed (GOOD)" instead of "Success with data (SECURITY ISSUE)"

## Further Security Recommendations

1. Regularly run security tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline
2. Consider adding server-side validation of wallet tokens in addition to database RLS
3. Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms if not already present
4. Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the authentication system
