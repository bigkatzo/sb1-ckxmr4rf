# Authentication Testing Guide

## Current Issue

The authentication flow was failing with "Email not confirmed" error. This happens because:

1. When a new wallet user is created via `supabase.auth.signUp()`, Supabase requires email confirmation by default
2. The wallet email (`wallet_address@wallet.local`) is not a real email, so confirmation fails
3. This prevents the user from accessing design pages due to RLS policy restrictions

## Current Solution

The current implementation handles this gracefully by:

1. **Attempting Supabase authentication** when wallet connects
2. **Creating wallet user** if it doesn't exist
3. **Continuing without Supabase auth** if email confirmation fails
4. **Using wallet headers** for RLS policies instead of JWT authentication

## Testing Steps

### 1. Check Authentication Status

In development mode, look for the **Auth Status** debug component in the bottom-right corner:

```
üîê Auth Status
Wallet: CP9mCLHEk2j9L6RTndQnHoUkyH8qZeEfTgEDtvqcL3Yn
Connected: Yes
Privy Auth: Yes
Supabase Auth: No (expected if email confirmation fails)
Session Token: No (expected if email confirmation fails)
Client Auth: Yes (should work with wallet headers)
```

### 2. Test Design Page Access

1. Connect wallet via Privy
2. Navigate to a product page: `/:collectionSlug/:productSlug`
3. Click "View Design Files" or navigate to `/:collectionSlug/:productSlug/design`
4. **Expected behavior**: Page should load without redirecting back to product page

### 3. Check Console Logs

Look for these log messages:

```
‚úÖ Wallet connected successfully, creating auth token...
üîê Authenticating to Supabase with wallet: CP9mCLHEk2j9L6RTndQnHoUkyH8qZeEfTgEDtvqcL3Yn
User does not exist, creating new wallet user...
‚úÖ Wallet user created successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è User created but email confirmation required
‚úì Creating Supabase client
```

### 4. Run Auth Test

Click the "Run Auth Test" button in the Auth Status component. You should see:

```
‚úÖ Authentication test passed! All systems working.
```

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Working Scenario
- Wallet connects successfully
- Supabase authentication fails gracefully (email confirmation issue)
- App continues to work with wallet headers
- Design page loads without redirects
- RLS policies work via wallet address headers

### ‚ùå Broken Scenario
- Design page redirects back to product page
- Console shows authentication errors
- RLS policies blocking access

## Debugging

### If Design Page Still Redirects

1. **Check RLS Policies**: Ensure the `check_design_access` function works with wallet headers
2. **Check Wallet Headers**: Verify `X-Wallet-Address` header is being sent
3. **Check Database**: Ensure wallet address is properly stored in orders table

### If Authentication Fails Completely

1. **Check Supabase Settings**: Email confirmation might be disabled
2. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure Supabase URL and keys are correct
3. **Check Network**: Ensure Supabase requests are not blocked

## Alternative Solutions

If the current approach doesn't work, consider:

1. **Disable Email Confirmation**: Configure Supabase to not require email confirmation
2. **Use Service Role**: Create users with service role key (more complex)
3. **Custom Authentication**: Implement custom JWT tokens (advanced)

## Current Status

The solution should work with the following flow:

1. User connects Privy wallet ‚úÖ
2. WalletContext attempts Supabase auth ‚úÖ
3. If email confirmation fails, continue gracefully ‚úÖ
4. Use wallet headers for RLS policies ‚úÖ
5. Design page loads without redirects ‚úÖ

The key insight is that **Supabase authentication is not required** for the app to work. The wallet headers provide sufficient authentication for RLS policies.
