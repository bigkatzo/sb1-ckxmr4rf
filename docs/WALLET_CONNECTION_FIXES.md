# Wallet Connection Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. MetaMask Prompt Issue
**Problem**: Even when connected to Phantom, the system automatically asks to sign in to MetaMask first.

**Root Cause**: Privy configuration was not properly restricting to Solana-only wallets.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `src/config/privy.ts` to force `walletChainType: 'solana-only'`
- Removed all EVM chain imports and configurations
- Ensured only Solana wallet connectors are available

### 2. Mobile Device Wallet Detection
**Problem**: On mobile devices (TWA and phone-sized devices), it says "no wallet to connect to" even when Phantom is installed.

**Root Cause**: No proper mobile wallet adapter implementation for TWA and mobile environments.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created `src/utils/mobileWalletAdapter.ts` with comprehensive mobile wallet detection
- Added TWA (Trusted Web Activity) environment detection
- Implemented multiple wallet detection methods for different environments
- Added deep linking support for mobile wallet apps
- Enhanced wallet detection with fallback mechanisms

### 3. Connection Error Message
**Problem**: When successfully connected, it shows an error "please connect solana..." then says "wallet connected".

**Root Cause**: The connection flow was showing error messages during the authentication process.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx` to improve connection flow
- Fixed the authentication token creation process
- Improved error handling to prevent false error messages
- Enhanced connection state management

### 7. `src/routes/index.tsx`
- Added `/wallet-test` route for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test MetaMask Issue Fix
1. Navigate to `/wallet-test` in development
2. Use the Mobile Wallet Test component
3. Check that only Solana wallets are shown (no MetaMask)
4. Verify connection flow doesn't prompt for MetaMask

### 2. Test Mobile Device Support
1. Test on mobile device or TWA environment
2. Use the Mobile Wallet Test component
3. Check environment detection (should show TWA/Mobile: Yes)
4. Test wallet detection (should detect Phantom if installed)
5. Test deep linking if wallet not detected

### 3. Test Connection Error Fix
1. Connect a wallet using the normal flow
2. Check that no "please connect solana..." error appears
3. Verify successful connection message
4. Test disconnect and reconnect flow

### 4. Debug Information
The Mobile Wallet Test component provides:
- Environment detection (TWA, Mobile, Display Mode)
- Wallet availability status
- Connection testing
- Debug logs
- Real-time status updates

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set:
- `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` - Your Privy app ID
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - WalletConnect project ID

## Mobile Wallet Support

### Supported Wallets
- **Phantom** (Priority 1)
- **Solflare** (Priority 2)
- **Backpack** (Priority 3)

### Mobile Environments
- **TWA (Trusted Web Activity)** - Android app wrapper
- **Mobile Browser** - Regular mobile browsers
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** - Standalone mode

### Deep Linking
If a wallet is not detected, the system will attempt to deep link to:
- Phantom: `https://phantom.app/ul/browse/`
- Solflare: `https://solflare.com/`
- Backpack: `https://backpack.app/`

## Troubleshooting

### If MetaMask Still Appears
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Check that `walletChainType: 'solana-only'` is set in Privy config
3. Verify no EVM chains are imported

### If Mobile Wallets Not Detected
1. Use the Mobile Wallet Test component to check environment
2. Verify wallet apps are installed
3. Check if TWA environment is properly detected
4. Test deep linking functionality

### If Connection Errors Persist
1. Use the Wallet Debugger component
2. Check console logs for detailed error information
3. Verify Privy configuration is correct
4. Test with different wallets

## Development Tools

### Mobile Wallet Test Component
Access via `/wallet-test` route or the floating test panel in development mode.

### Wallet Debugger Component
Provides detailed wallet connection debugging information.

### Console Logging
Enhanced logging for wallet detection, connection, and error states.

## Next Steps

1. **Test on Real Devices**: Test the fixes on actual mobile devices and TWA environments
2. **Monitor Logs**: Use the test components to monitor wallet connection behavior
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on wallet connection experience
4. **Performance**: Monitor for any performance impacts from the mobile wallet adapter

## Support

If issues persist after implementing these fixes:
1. Use the Mobile Wallet Test component to gather debugging information
2. Check console logs for specific error messages
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set
4. Test with different wallet apps and devices
