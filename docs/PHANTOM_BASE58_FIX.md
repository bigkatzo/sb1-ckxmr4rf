# Phantom Wallet Base58 Error Fix

## Problem
After connecting Phantom wallet to the codebase, it throws a "non-base 58" error when trying to create a Solana `PublicKey` object.

## Root Cause
The error occurs because:
1. **Wrong Default Chain**: Privy was configured with Ethereum as the default chain instead of Solana
2. **Invalid Address Format**: When users connect Phantom (a Solana wallet), Privy was providing Ethereum address format instead of Solana base58 format
3. **Missing Validation**: No validation was in place to check if the wallet address is a valid Solana address before creating a `PublicKey`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Privy Configuration (`src/config/privy.ts`)
- Changed `walletChainType` from `'ethereum-and-solana'` to `'solana'`
- Set Solana as the default chain instead of Ethereum
- Reordered supported chains to prioritize Solana
- Removed email login to focus on wallet connections

### 2. Added Address Validation (`src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx`)
- Added `isValidSolanaAddress()` helper function
- Added validation before creating `PublicKey` objects
- Added debugging logs to track wallet address format
- Enhanced error handling for base58 errors

### 3. Improved Error Messages
- Added specific error messages for base58 errors
- Guide users to connect Solana wallets like Phantom
- Added validation feedback in connection flow

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive wallet address validation tests
- Added Privy user object inspection
- Added base58 format checking

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Use the Wallet Debugger
```typescript
import { WalletDebugger } from './components/wallet/WalletDebugger';

// Add to your page for testing
<WalletDebugger />
```

### 2. Check Console Logs
Look for these debug messages:
- `Wallet info: { address, chainId, chainType, walletClientType }`
- `Raw wallet address from Privy: [address]`
- `PublicKey creation successful: [address]` or `PublicKey creation failed: [error]`

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ✅ Phantom wallet should connect without base58 errors
- ✅ Wallet address should be in Solana base58 format (32-44 characters, alphanumeric)
- ✅ `PublicKey` creation should succeed
- ✅ Authentication should work properly

## Troubleshooting

### If Base58 Error Still Occurs:

1. **Check Wallet Type**: Ensure user is connecting Phantom (Solana wallet) not MetaMask (Ethereum wallet)

2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache and localStorage to reset Privy state

3. **Check Privy Configuration**: Verify `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` is set correctly

4. **Check Console Logs**: Look for wallet info logs to see what address format Privy is providing

5. **Force Solana Chain**: If needed, manually switch to Solana chain in Privy modal

### Common Issues:

- **Ethereum Address**: If you see an address starting with `0x`, it's an Ethereum address
- **Invalid Length**: Solana addresses should be 32-44 characters
- **Wrong Characters**: Solana addresses use base58 encoding (no 0, O, I, l characters)

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Always validate wallet addresses before creating `PublicKey` objects
2. Use appropriate chain configuration for your target blockchain
3. Add comprehensive error handling for wallet connection issues
4. Test with multiple wallet types to ensure compatibility
