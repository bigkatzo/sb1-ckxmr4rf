# Product Notes and Free Notes Fields

## Current Status
The notes and free notes functionality is fully implemented and operational in the product system.

## Implementation Overview
1. `src/components/merchant/forms/ProductForm/ProductBasicInfo.tsx`
   - Includes notes and free notes input fields in the UI
   - Properly configured with React Hook Form
   - Provides default placeholder text for guidance

2. `src/services/products.ts`
   - `createProduct` function processes and stores notes and free notes
   - `updateProduct` function handles updating notes and free notes
   - Both include proper validation and error handling

3. Database Structure
   - Notes stored in JSONB column with schema validation
   - Free notes stored in TEXT column

## Data Structure
The notes and free notes fields follow this structure:
```typescript
notes: {
  shipping?: string;
  quality?: string;
  returns?: string;
}
freeNotes?: string;
```
